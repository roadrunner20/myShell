# myShell
into a C program to act like a small shell that processes single commands entered by the user. In particular, the program assembles the command and execute it. The commands/programs location can be anywhere in $PATH and might have arguments. E.g., if the input-line entered by the user is ls -F your program should assemble this command-lines and execute it.
